# Trajectory_Prediction
This is a data-based trajectory prediction project. In the future traffic scenario. Self-driving vehicles ought to predict the future trajectory of the surrouding vehicles so that they can plan their own future motion.

With the development of deep learning, we decide to use a data-driven method to solve this task using the recurrent network like LSTM and GRU. And the digital map used in this project is Lanelet2.
